    "- Confirm synthetic point accuracy after getting $\\Delta t$ from Zsuzsa\n",
    "- Develop alignment system that will support direct comparison of tracks\n",
    "    - The pre-alignment procedure should lead to each embryo positioned with its AP axis parallel to the horizonal axis of the image\n",
    "    - In this case it may be sufficient to just translate each track so that it starts at the origin and use that for comparison on a qualitative level\n",
    "- Also need an alignment system that supports temporal alignment\n",
    "    - Mesoderm invagination seems like a potential global marker, but I need to implement a system to either detect or collect user input about that timepoint\n",
    "- Other metrics?\n",
    "    - Rolling calculation of velocity?\n",
    "    - Select benchmark time point, e.g. after 20mins the germband has extended x distance"
